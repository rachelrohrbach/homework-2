                <p>My interest in software development began back in college when I took a business programming class.
                    I found the class challenging yet intriguing.
                    It was too late in my degree program to transition to anything more technical, so I graduated from
                    Seattle University with a bachelor of arts in Business Administration and an Entrepreneurship minor.
                    Throughout college I worked in the service industry supporting myself working jobs baking, ice cream
                    making, and in catering operations.
                    After graduating I went on to work in hospitality as a hotel sales coordinator, catering sales
                    manager, and event manager. Beginning to feel burnt out I decided to pursue software development.
                    I spent almost a year attempting to self-study via online courses, attending a few women who code
                    workshops, and taking time to travel, but then decided that more formal instruction was key to
                    making a career transition.
                </p>

                <p>When I’m not attending class at the University of Washington’s Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp
                    or studying, I enjoy cooking, baking, traveling, playing the world’s only 10-player arcade game
                    Killer Queen, reading, and spending time with friends and family.
                    Upon completion of the boot camp I’m looking forward to using my software developer skills to work
                    in the non-profit field.
