## General info
This project is my personal web developer portfolio. This project is an improvement on a former website that I built as this one employs Bootstrap v4.4.1 to make it responsive and mobile-friendly. It also minimized the amount of CSS that I had to write since Bootstrap has already done most of the heavy lifting. The website provides potential employers a showcase of my applications and skills. Witin the website you can learn some background about me and you will eventually be able to actually see examples of some of the projects that I have worked on. It also provides a contact form for interested parties to get in touch with me. The portfolio content is still limited at this point, but it will grow and improve with time as I spend more time coding. 
	
## Technologies

## Credits
I consulted Bootstrap 4 (https://getbootstrap.com/) and W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/default.asp) extensively in creating my project. Some other resources that I used include: Stack Overflow (#https://stackoverflow.com/) and the GitLab repository for my course, specifically referencing in-class activities.
